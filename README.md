# SuperSpam 3


## project aborted. because i lost interest in SuperSpam at least on the C# version. maybe the java version will replace superspam. I'm also thinking to public the sourcecode.


Advanced program for keypress automation.

Here we are SuperSpam 3! A new rewritten & clean ui!

For now SuperSpam 3 is not working yet, if you want to have a working version use the 2.x branch.
