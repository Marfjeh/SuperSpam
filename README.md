# SuperSpam
Advanced program for keypress automation.

#There will no longer be a 2.6 update. SuperSpam³ (3.0.0) will take it's place. A newly rewritten version planned to start around 2017. 

For now the SuperSpam³ has its own brach before it will merge with master, and Superspam² will get it's own branch for legacy support(maybe).
